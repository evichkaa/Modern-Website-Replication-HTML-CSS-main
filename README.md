Assignment: https://www.loom.com/share/fe08d5016a034df08cf0d29cb344e891

This assignment was given to me by the company that I'm currently working for as a Junior Full-Stack Developer.

I only had to imitate the design of the HOME.png image but I understood that I have to create the one from the ELEMENTS.png image as well and by the time they answered me if I had to create it too I was almost done with it so I just decided to complete it nonetheless :D
